Primary Control Constructs
    - sequences - code is gonna run in a specific order, top down, functions, etc
    - Selection - the idea of the code being able to run certain bits of code instead of others (different paths)
    - Repetion  - running a specific set of code over and over again
                1. Iteration - like a for/while loop
                2. Recursion - a function that calls itself

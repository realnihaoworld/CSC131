# Def: The probability of something occurring is
# the number of ways of achieving success out of 
# the total number of possibilities that exist

# Probability is a value between 0 and 1.
# 0 means no chance it happens
# 1 means 100% chance it happens

# Ex: probability of rolling a 2 on a six sided die
successes = 1
total_possibilities = 6
probability = successes / total_possibilities
print(probability)

# Ex: probability of rolling an even number
successes = 3
total_possibilities = 6
probability = successes / total_possibilities
print(probability)

# probability of heads and tails with two coins
# calculate the probability of each of the following:
# Possibilities:
# First Coin    Second Coin
# HEADS         HEADS
# HEADS         TAILS
# TAIL          HEADS
# TAILS         TAILS

# There is a probability of 0.25 for both being heads
# Prob for both being tails is 0.25
# Probability for one being heads, one being tails is 0.5
